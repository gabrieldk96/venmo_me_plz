# *Venmo*: Social Media meets Banking
## Overview and Origin
---
*Venmo* - Born in 2009

Just over a decade ago, Magdon-Ismail and Andrew Kortina were inspired to create a free and easy way to make payments between friends, colleagues, and even your grandma.
Essentially the two created a fun, easy-to-use peer-to-peer payment system that appears more like a Twitter feed than a payment app. Venmo caught wind and became largely popular to the point of processing over $12 billion in transactions during Q1 2018 and is now a subsidiary of payment giant, Paypal.
