# *Venmo*: Social Media meets Banking
## Overview and Origin
---
*Venmo* - Born in 2009

Just over a decade ago, Magdon-Ismail and Andrew Kortina were inspired to create a free and easy way to make payments between friends, colleagues, and even your grandma.
Essentially the two created a fun, easy-to-use peer-to-peer payment system that appears more like a Twitter feed than a payment app. Venmo caught wind and became largely popular to the point of processing over $12 billion in transactions during Q1 2018 and is now a subsidiary of payment giant, Paypal.

The company came a long way since its inception. Roughly $1.2 million in [seed money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venmo) was raised in 2010 and once the service gained momentous popularity in 2012, the company was acquired by Braintree for $26.2 million. The Venmo we know today is a child of Paypal, who acquired Braintree for $800 million in 2013
### Business Activities

Venmo was created to make settling debts between friends and making quick payments through your phone possible without having your wallet handy. The original concept was cemented when Ismail realized he forgot his wallet on his way to visit Kortina.

The intended user is ideally thought to be a young millenial who knows their way around social media, but really the app is intended for anyone with a smartphone. As of mid-2019, Venmo has grown to an astonishing [40 million users](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venmo) according to their earnings report. Something that greatly distinguishes Venmo from other players in the field is the incorporation of the social media format its users interact with. The use of short memos used to track payments include emojis and makes sending payments between friends fun.

Although using Venmo might feel new and innovative, the fact is that the company still relies on extisting payment infrastructure that is largely outdated, such as bank-to-bank transfers. Despite this fact, the company has amassed many loyal users and will only benefit as banks update their software to the 21st century and technologies such as blockchain and cryptocurrency could be implemented.

#### Landscape

Venmo is a large player in the domain of mobile peer-to-peer payments as a subsidiary of Braintree and now PayPal, competing against the likes of CashApp, Zelle, Apple Pay, and Google Wallet.

Venmo has been at the forefront of this domain due to its immense user base and the volume of transactions that are processed daily from these users. In the realm of mobile P2P payment apps, Venmo has set the bar high and set the trend of combining the social media format to its payment system. As mentioned above, the capability to apply newer FinTech methods to the business model will allow Venmo to take its service to the next level and set the trend in the next 5-10 years.

#### Results

In measuring performance, social media firms taunt their number of users to represent their market share. Financial services firms, specifically those that are involved in payments/billing, report the volume of transactions completed within a given time. Since Venmo seems to be the best of both worlds, both figures are important. In Q1 2018 alone, Venmo processed over $12 billion per their earnings statement and recorded over 40 million users in mid-2019.

Compared to its closest competitor, Cash App, Venmo has reported roughly [twice](https://www.vox.com/2018/2/27/17059182/square-cash-app-monthly-active-users-customers-seven-million-december-venmo) the amount of monthly users as CashApp. The interesting thing to note here is that though Venmo is on top, CashApp sits at the number one spot for top free finance apps, while Venmo takes the number three spot. With this in mind, the business impact of Venmo is blatant; the capacity to process billions in payments and sustain an immense userbase has gained Venmo a spot as one of the top players in this domain.

#### Recommendations
As mentioned above, Venmo has an outstanding userbase and has set the trend for the way we process mobile payments, but the technology its based on is virtually archaic. Recommendations I would make to Venmo would include adapting the most up-to-date ACH and banking systems as they become available as well as incorporate cryptocurrency/blockchain technology to prepare for the next generation of payments as well as to facilitate international payments.

Implementing these changes would greatly benefit Venmo because it has already gain the trust of millions of monthly users and these technologies will benefit these users in the next coming years as technology progresses and is more widespread. A broader array of services will be offered to cater to cryptocurrency payments, international transations, and overall make the payment systems more efficient. Implementing these changes will help Venmo remain competitive as a large market player for many years to come.
